                  The hack is only a small part of the competition. The real
                  spirit lies in building your network in the growing tech
                  community and collaborating with some of the finest minds of
                  the nation. Just remember, taking the Hackathons too seriously
                  defeats the purpose. Save the seriousness for pitching to
                  investors. Keeping an open mind will open new doors, help
                  build new relationships and acquire new skills.This is
